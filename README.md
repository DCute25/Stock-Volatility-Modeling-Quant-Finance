# NVIDIA Volatility Modeling (2018–2024)

This project was completed as part of the course **Quantitative Methods for Financial Markets** by **Monash University**, where I analyzed the volatility of NVIDIA (NVDA) stock using time series econometric models in R.

## Project Overview

- Modeled daily stock volatility of NVIDIA Corporation from **September 2018 to August 2024**
- Implemented **ARCH(2)**, **GARCH(1,1)**, and **GJR-GARCH(1,1)-t** models using the `rugarch` package in R
- Evaluated model fit using **Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)**
- Forecasted **Value at Risk (VaR)** and conducted **Unconditional and Conditional Coverage backtests**
- Developed practical understanding of **volatility modeling, financial risk analysis**, and **time series forecasting**

## Tools & Skills

- **R programming** (data manipulation, time series modeling, forecasting)
- `rugarch`, `PerformanceAnalytics`, `quantmod`, `zoo`, and other relevant R packages
- **Financial econometrics**, **risk modeling**, and **statistical testing**

## Files

- `nvidia_data.csv` – Cleaned dataset of NVIDIA daily stock prices  
- `volatility_modeling.R` – Core R script implementing the models and analysis  
- `vola_modeling_final_report.pdf` – Brief summary of the methodology and results (optional, if you have it)

## Key Takeaways

This project strengthened my ability to apply theoretical models to real market data, enhanced my skills in statistical programming and risk modeling, and provided hands-on experience with evaluating financial models' predictive performance.
